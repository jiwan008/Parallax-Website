    <h2 class="secHeading">Adventure Time ! </h2>

    <p class="text">Adventures are some of the moments in life, which makes our heart pump faster and gives us the feeling of being alive and full. It is an exciting experience very different from our normal daily routine. The adventure also brings with it a certain amount of risk. It brings thrill with it, and we can feel the wind rushing. Some people love adventures and live for them. Others use it as a means of escape from their normal lives. Whatever be the reason, adventure makes people feel great about being able to live those moments.
    <br><br>
    Activities like horse riding, bungee jumping, river rafting, parasailing, skiing, kayaking, paragliding, mountain climbing, freefalls etc. are called adventure activities. All of these activities also have a risk factor, but that is what makes them exciting. Adventure activities must be done under expert supervision, which will keep you safe in case of any emergency situation. Everyone should indulge in some adventure activity in their lives because we only live once.

        <h2 class="desc">Biking</h2>

    </div>

    <p class="text">Cycling (also known as bicycling or biking) is the riding of bicycles (also cycles, or bikes) for leisure or as part of competition. In many countries, the cycle is also an important mode of transport, more so in Asia (especially in Southeast Asia) and Africa. In Europe, cycling is predominantly a recreational activity. The continent is very much the hub of cycling as a competitive sport, but modern Europeans are increasingly inclined to use the bike as a favoured mode of transport (from home to office – and back). Indeed, across the world today, the cycle is the preferred means of conveyance for many commuters. Compared to the ubiquitous motorcar, cycles contribute almost nothing to air or noise pollution, besides giving the rider plenty of opportunity to get in some exercise
        <br><br>
        In cities, bikes help lessen traffic congestion and assist in solving seemingly perennial parking problems, as well as offering easier manoeuvrability. The bike, then, has plenty of things going for it – it’s kinder to the environment; it costs little to buy, operate and maintain; it is incredibly convenient to own; and it is the ideal way to fitness. All of these factors contribute towards making cycling a fun and enjoyable activity.
There are three types of cycling: Utility, recreational (touring, organized rides, mountain) and racing.

            <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
    
        </div>
    
        <p class="text">The dream of flying in the sky just like a bird is as old as human kind. You can make your dream come true with paragliding. This sport is considered to be risky, but the reality is that the safety of practitioners is quite high, especially compared to other adventure disciplines. Of course, you cannot paraglide unless you have undergone extensive training. There are numerous paragliding schools that you can select from. It is only natural for you to look for courses in your local area, but there are a number of other essential factors that you have to consider carefully as well.
            <br><br>
            The first thing to decide on is the type of paragliding that you want to practice. The glider is made from one canopy. The entire mechanism represents the one of a parachute. The gliding principle is the same. However, given that the paraglider is lighter and more portable, it is easier to fly. You can readily start training for this discipline in any of the paragliding schools. Once you master the necessary skills, you can you can start on your own.

            <p class="text">Surfing, sport of riding breaking waves towards the shore, particularly by means of a board. Surfing’s roots dwell pre-modern Hawaii and Polynesia, where the game was practiced by both men and women from all social strata from royalty to commoners. Organized competitions helped to counter this negative image and to win surfing some social respectability. Here is everything you need to know about surfing in India.
                <br><br>
                Surfing in India is growing in quality, and there are some great spots along the country’s vast coastline where you can catch a wave and also learn to surf. The only issue is that the waves are not consistent and also the surf will flop sometimes. You just need to be at the correct place at the correct time!Surf-worthy waves hit Indian shores all year round, averaging between three to five feet, however the season for large waves is from May to September. This is the pre-monsoon and monsoon season. At this point, the swells vary from eight to fifteen feet, with the largest waves rolling in almost always on the West Coast.
